Tasks
-----

***sass***

reads the file `styles.scss` from the `/src/sass/` folder and compiles it to `/public/css/styles.css`

***js***
	 
reads the file `app.js` or `app.jsx` (depending on the arguments passed to gulp) from the `/src/js/` folder and compiles it to `/public/js/app.js`

***images***

reads `JPG, PNG and GIF` files from the `/src/assets/images/` folder, optimizes them and pastes them into `/public/assets/images/`

***watch***

watches every change in the `/src/` folder and starts the right tasks, if there is a change

***copy-phaser***

copies the current `phaser.min.js` file from the `node_modules` folder to the `public/js` folder


----------


Default task
------------

if you run

    gulp

everything is compiled and then watched, **browsersync** is also started at the **port 8089** and after every change, the browser will be refreshed.

if you run 

    gulp --react

the system needs a `app.jsx` file in the `/src/js/` folder.
